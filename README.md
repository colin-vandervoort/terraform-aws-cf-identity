# Terraform AWS CloudFront Support
Terraform module to provision DNS and ACM resources for a CloudFront distribution. Read the configurations and tests in the `terratest` directory for examples.

Domains must be registered in AWS Route53 for this module to function as intended.

I may continue to refactor this code, so I don't recommend importing it directly.
